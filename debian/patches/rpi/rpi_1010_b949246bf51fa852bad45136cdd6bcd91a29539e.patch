    pinctrl-bcm2835: Only request the interrupts listed in the DTB
    
    Although the GPIO controller can generate three interrupts (four counting
    the common one), the device tree files currently only specify two. In the
    absence of the third, simply don't register that interrupt (as opposed to
    registering 0), which has the effect of making it impossible to generate
    interrupts for GPIOs 46-53 which, since they share pins with the SD card
    interface, is unlikely to be a problem.
